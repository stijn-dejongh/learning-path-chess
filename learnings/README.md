# â™Ÿ Chess Quick Reference â€” Principles & In-Game Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles (Tailored to My Weaknesses)

1. **Before Every Move â€” Blunder-Check Cycle**
    - Ask: *What did my opponentâ€™s last move change?*
    - Look for new checks, captures, and threats.
    - Spot hanging pieces (mine & theirs).

2. **Early Game Discipline**
    - Develop knights & bishops before extra pawn moves (except e/d pawns in center).
    - Castle by move 8â€“10 unless opponentâ€™s king is more exposed.
    - Avoid chasing the queen with pawns â€” develop with tempo instead.

3. **Building Attacks**
    - Create two or more threats at once.
    - Bring all pieces into the attack before sacrificing.
    - Between attacks, improve the worst-placed piece.

4. **Handling Early Opponent Queen Moves**
    - Develop while attacking the queen.
    - Block central lines and keep the king safe.

5. **When Ahead**
    - Trade pieces, not pawns.
    - Avoid risky complications â€” choose the simplest winning route.
    - Simplify into endings I know.

6. **When Behind**
    - Complicate â€” open the position, create threats.
    - Avoid unnecessary trades.
    - Look for perpetual checks and stalemate traps.

## âœ… In-Game Decision Checklist

Before making my move:

- [ ] **Opponentâ€™s Last Move:**
    - Did it create a new threat?
    - Did it leave a weakness?
- [ ] **Checks/Captures/Threats:**
    - Can they check me next move?
    - Can they capture something?
    - Are there forks, pins, skewers, or discovered attacks?
- [ ] **Hanging Pieces:**
    - Can I win material?
    - Am I leaving something undefended?
- [ ] **King Safety:**
    - Is my king safe enough for my plan?
    - Should I castle or block threats first?
- [ ] **Plan Fit:**
    - Does this move improve my position or defend a weakness?
    - Is it consistent with my opening/motif?
- [ ] **Counterplay:**
    - After my move, what is their *best* reply?
    - Can I handle it comfortably?

*Tip:* If unsure, choose the move that **improves the worst-placed piece** or reinforces king safety.  
Over time, aim to run through this checklist in 10â€“15 seconds per move.
