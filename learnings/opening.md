# Learning for Openings

To limit the scope of my opening study, I focus on a few key openings that align with my style and learning goals. This allows me to build a solid foundation without overwhelming myself with too many lines.

As such, I have chosen the following openings:
- **White:** Italian Game (Giuoco Piano)
- **Black vs 1.e4:** Caroâ€“Kann Advance
- **Black vs 1.d4:** Slav Defence

## ðŸŽ¯ My Learning Focus

### Caroâ€“Kann

- Recognize *when* the `â€¦c5` or `â€¦f6` breaks are ready â€” all pieces out, king safe.
- Use exchanges like `â€¦Bxd3` to remove Whiteâ€™s key defenders (especially vs Bd3).
- Avoid passivity â€” improve worst-placed piece if no clear pawn break.

### Slav Defence

- Recognize the timing for `â€¦c5` â€” all minor pieces developed, king castled, rooks connected.
- Use `â€¦Bf5` (or `â€¦Bg4`) before locking in with `â€¦e6` to keep the light-squared bishop active.

### Italian Game

- Recognize when to switch from slow buildup to central pawn break.
- Avoid overextending pawns too early â€” donâ€™t let Black counter in the center before youâ€™re ready.
- Develop harmoniously; avoid chasing quick tactics at the expense of piece coordination.
