# 🏹 Chess Improvement Dashboard — Targeting Current Weaknesses

## 🎯 Purpose
This plan focuses on correcting my **recurring weak points** while keeping the training fun and measurable.  
It ties each weakness to a clear skill target and a deliberate practice loop.

## 🔍 My Top Weaknesses & Targets

1. **Overextending Pawns Early**
    - **Target Skill:** Limit to 1–2 non-central pawn moves in the first 8 moves unless tactically justified.
    - **Positive Habit:** “Knights & bishops out before chasing pawns.”

2. **Single-Shot Attacks**
    - **Target Skill:** Layer threats (e.g., pin + attack, open file + piece activity).
    - **Positive Habit:** After a threat is defended, improve the *worst-placed piece*.

3. **Handling Early Opponent Queen**
    - **Target Skill:** Respond with development, not endless pawn chasing.
    - **Positive Habit:** Develop while hitting the queen; avoid self-weakening.

4. **King Safety Neglect**
    - **Target Skill:** Castle by move 8–10 unless opponent’s king is in greater danger.
    - **Positive Habit:** Treat castling as part of development, not optional.

5. **Missing Opponent Tactics**
    - **Target Skill:** Blunder-check before *every* move.
    - **Positive Habit:** “What changed? Can they check/capture/threaten?”

## 🎯 Weekly Focus Rotation

| Week | Focus                        | Goal Metric                                        |
|------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Early Development Discipline | ≤2 pawn moves before 8th move (unless justified)   |
| 1    | Blunder-Check Routine        | Apply before 90%+ of moves                         |
| 2    | Layered Threats              | ≥1 game where I maintain two threats for 3+ moves  |
| 2    | King Safety                  | 80%+ games castled by move 10                      |
| 3    | Queen Harassment Handling    | No more than 2 pawn moves chasing queen in opening |


## 🔄 Deliberate Practice Loop (Per Focus)

1. **Review 2–3 model games** showing the correct habit in my repertoire openings.
2. **Play 5 rapid games** applying only this focus — ignore other mistakes unless catastrophic.
3. **After each game**, log:
    - Did I meet the focus metric?
    - One example where I succeeded or failed.
4. **Tally hit rate** at week’s end.

5. **Adjust next week’s focus** based on common misses and successes.
