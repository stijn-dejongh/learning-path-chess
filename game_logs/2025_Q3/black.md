|:------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Opening Played:**           | Caro‚ÄìKann (misplayed ‚Äî Classical sideline)                                                                                     | 
| **Habit Focus:**              | Threat analysis & development                                                                                                  | 
| **Motif Focus:**              | Bishop safety (‚Äúcoffin‚Äù avoidance)                                                                                             | 
| **Result:**                   | Loss                                                                                                                           | 
| **Metric Hit?**               | N ‚Äî early loss of structural plan                                                                                              |
| **Example Success:**          | Move 20 ‚Äî Found Bf4 to challenge knight and fight for activity                                                                 |
| **Example Miss:**             | Move 3 ‚Äî Skipped mainline Caro pawn trade, missing solid structure                                                             |
| **Motif Applied?**            | Partially ‚Äî avoided trapping own bishop, but lost direction in plan                                                            |
| **Key Moment:**               | Move 9 Nxf7?! ‚Äî speculative sac without follow-up led to worse position                                                        |
| **Reason for miss:**          | Over-focus on creating immediate threats rather than consolidating development                                                 |
| **Adjustment for next game:** | Commit to mainline Caro pawn trade even if it conflicts with pawn move metric; avoid early speculative sacs without clear gain |
